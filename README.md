# agodasaas

To use the saas: 
1) git clone the URL https://github.com/marcdc123/agodasaas.git
2) create a pip environment and activate it
3) type pip install -r requirement.txt
4) type python manage.py runserver
5) go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/results to get your results and voila !
6) to create new users and get new results, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log with username: marcd, pwd: a. 
 Here you can first create the users then place them in the categories you wish, you can also create new groups, reaffect the existing users, etc. 
7) the SQL query of the results can be seen in the console 

Thanks, 

Marc
